# About Me
Hi my username is NavineClient! I am a friend of the Navine maker himself ProJakob! I can not tell you my age just yet, but I support Navine themselves and I will watch over them.
My gender is unknown. My pronouns are also unknown. The reason why my username is NavineClient is because I wanted to take the name so others couldn't call themselves the real NavineClient and make the client and say it's theirs.
I will be posting alot of things here soon when ever I have the time to post here!

# Hobbies
## Minecraft
Well I do play some minecraft, but It's hard to find me.
I am in the process of making a Minecraft Server for some people that would like to play on the server.
## Skripting
I do make skripts and I will be making another spot for skripts i make and I will Release them soon!
## Updates Of Skripting
So, I been being told that the skripts I make are not mine. I have been learning skripting for 5-7 months or maybe longer and when I see a skript, I try to make it my own way. I had gotten told that I don't code anything since the skripts I make are not really mine. When I see a skript, I'll study it, then I'll make it my own way by making it very different or I will just use Skript Docs as the main source until I get the skript the right way. If you have ever seen a `lightning stick for a right click event` in skripting, well I was told that I had copied it from someone else, but here's the thing, I use Skript Docs if I don't like how someone's skript was made and I'll try to make it my own way. Now, when you tell someone that they don't code anything and keep telling someone that they can't code in skripting, that I think to myself is considered `Harassment`. Don't tell people they can't code since it might end up looking bad for you.

## Navine Updates
**Navine** is currently being disabled for who knows how long. @ProJakob has decided that **Navine** will be discontinued and will no longer be developed. How ever, just because **Navine** is being discontinued doesn't mean you all can redevelop it. It was rightfully owned and made by him. He gets to decide what to do with the client.
## Navine Sneak Peaks
**Coming Soon!!!**
